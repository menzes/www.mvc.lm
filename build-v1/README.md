### ICTPRG418|ICTPRG527: Web Object Oriented Programming (2016, Term 4) Assessment MVC Project ##


HOW TO SETUP --

- Start your local web server ( I use XAMPP )
- Add the project into your HTACCESS folder
- Add the appropriate information into your VHOSTS file
- Add the local address to your hosts file
- configure the config.php file located in the projects directory my one looks like this "define('URL' , 'http://www.mvc.lm:8080/build-v1/');" to what suits you

I will attach a video of this MVC assignment working on my PC.
